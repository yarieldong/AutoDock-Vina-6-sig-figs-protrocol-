We used ZINC (https://zinc15.docking.org/) to select compounds that are similar to the compounds with positive dT according to Dr. Perry's result from wet lab.

How to use ZINC:
1. From the top menu bar, select **Subtances**.
2. Type the SMILES id of compounds with positive dT into the text entry box.
3. At the bottom of the page, tap on **Nothing selected** and select **In Stock**. This ensures we select the compounds that are in stock and ready to go when Dr. Perry place the order.
4. Tap on **Search with** and it gives you options:
- Default: it gives you all the information on the compound you input.
- Similarity 40: it returns all the compounds that have Tanimoto Score > 0.4 compared to the input.
- Similarity 30: it returns all the compounds that have Tanimoto Score > 0.3 compared to the input.
5. You can download all the compounds with the format you want.
